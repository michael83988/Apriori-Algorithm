# Apriori-Algorithm

"Apriori algorithm" is a method in the region of association rule analysis. One can find some rules which may be like 'if A happens, then B will probably happen too with a probability over xx%' through this algorithm. Here are functions in this module:

## for_test(*args):
Just to show that the module is imported properly if the result is "成功引用Apriori module囉!" and arguments will be shown meanwhile.

## show_param(*args):
Show all global variables in the module:
+ support: The frequency that X -> Y association happens in the total dataset.
